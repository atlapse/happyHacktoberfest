### Looking for free tee but feel like cheating?

Instead of ~~just adding your name to README~~ lets share a little story about why you love coding, languages you love, languages you hate, current project that you are working on and *if you would like to connect with/help people with same interest.*    


**_You in?_**

#### Example:  _(add yours in myStory folder)_    
 - they call me :    
 - love to code because :    
 - languages i speak better than my mothertongue :    
 - languages i wanna nuke :    
 - my swagger website :    
 - whats left of my social life : [github](https://github.com/) [twitter](https://twitter.com/) [whatever](https://x.y/)    
 - can help you get your shit together or maybe you could help me get mine : yes and yes
